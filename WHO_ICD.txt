Pain severity scale value ()
The chronic pain severity scale value is a compound measure comprised of pain intensity, pain-related distress, and pain-related interference. Each of this measures is a patient rating.
Pain intensity ()
Pain intensity is defined as the strength of the subjective pain experience (“how much does the pain hurt?”) The patient should be asked to rate the average pain intensity for the last week on an 11-point numerical rating scale (ranging from 0 ‘no pain’ to 10 ‘worst pain imaginable’) or a 100mm visual rating scale.
  XS5B  	No pain
Pain intensity rating NRS: 0

  XS5D  	Mild pain
Pain intensity rating NRS: 1-3

  XS9Q  	Moderate pain
Pain intensity rating NRS: 4-6

  XS2E  	Severe pain
Pain intensity rating NRS: 7-10

Pain-related distress ()
Pain-related distress is defined as the multifactorial unpleasant emotional experience of a cognitive, behavioral, emotional, social, or spiritual nature due to the chronic pain (“how distressed are you by the pain?) The patient should be asked to rate the average pain-related distress they experienced in the last week on an 11-point numerical rating scale (ranging from 0 ‘no pain-related distress’ to 10 ‘extreme pain-related distress’) or a 100mm visual rating scale.
  XS1J  	No distress
Pain-related distress rating NRS: 0

  XS3R  	Mild distress
Pain-related distress rating NRS: 1-3

  XS7C  	Moderate distress
Pain-related distress rating NRS: 4-6

  XS7N  	Severe distress
Pain-related distress rating NRS: 7-10

Pain-related interference ()
Pain-related interference is a measure for how much the pain interferes with daily activities and participation (“how much does the pain interfere with your life?”). The patient should be asked to rate the average pain-related interference they experienced in the last week on an 11-point numerical rating scale (ranging from 0 ‘no interference’ to 10 ‘unable to carry on activities’) or a 100mm visual rating scale.
  XS71  	No pain-related interference
Pain-related interference rating NRS: 0

  XS5R  	Mild pain-related interference
Pain-related interference rating NRS: 1-3

  XS2L  	Moderate pain-related interference
Pain-related interference rating NRS: 4-6

  XS2U  	Severe pain-related interference
Pain-related interference rating NRS: 7-10

Presence of psychosocial factors scale value ()
Use this extension code to code the presence or absence of problematic emotional (e.g., anger, fear), cognitive (e.g., excessive worry, catastrophizing), behavioral (e.g., avoidance) or social factors (eg, work, relationships) that accompany a given health condition (e.g., chronic pain). The code for the presence of psychosocial factors is appropriate when there is positive evidence that psychological or social factors contribute to the cause, the maintenance or the exacerbation of the health condition, or associated disability, or when the health condition results in negative psychobehavioral consequences (eg, demoralisation, hopelessness, avoidance, withdrawal). Assigning this extension code does not require a judgement regarding aetiological contributions or causal priorities.

As they are the most aggressive of the pineal parenchymal tumours, they are usually associated with a poor prognosis.
