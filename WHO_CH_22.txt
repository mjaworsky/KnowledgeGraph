CHAPTER 22
Injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes
This chapter has 235 four-character categories.
Code range starts with NA00
In the ICD, injury means physical or physiological bodily harm resulting from interaction of the body with energy (mechanical, thermal, electrical, chemical or radiant, or due to extreme pressure) in an amount, or at a rate of transfer, that exceeds physical or physiological tolerance. Injury can also result from lack of vital elements, such as oxygen. Poisoning by and toxic effects of substances are included, as is damage of or due to implanted devices. Maltreatment syndromes are included even if physical or physiological bodily harm has not been reported. Otherwise, psychological effects are not included (e.g. injured feelings).
Injury usually has rapid onset in response to a well-defined event (e.g. a car crash, striking the ground after falling, drinking a strongly alkaline liquid, an overdose of a medication, a burn sustained during a surgical procedure). These events are often referred to as external causes of injury. The injurious energy can, however, originate from the injured person and/or from his or her immediate environment (e.g. a person running on a hot day sustains heat exhaustion), and injury can be caused by the injured person (i.e. intentional self-harm).
Injury includes manifestations that are evident immediately after onset, which may persist or not, and manifestations that first become evident at a later date.

NA02.70	Fracture of condylar process of mandible
Condylar process fractures are defined as fractures running above or posterior to a line confined by the sigmoid notch line and the masseteric notch line. The mandibular condylar process comprises three fracture levels and is subdivided into the head region, the condylar neck, and the condylar base. Fractures of the condylar head show typical fracture lines either within the lateral pole zone, which may lead to loss of vertical height, or medially to the pole zone, with the latter ones usually not compromising the vertical condyle to disc and fossa relation. Fractures of the condylar neck and base can be differentiated according to radiologically based rules with regard to the proportion of the fracture line above and below the level of the sigmoid notch, and are basically subdivided according to the presence or absence of displacement or dislocation. Further parameters for definition are presence or absence of fragmentation, sideward displacement (medially or laterally), angulation of the superior main fragment and fracture-site geometry (e.g. straight or oblique, interfragmentary interdigitation)

  NA03  	Dislocation or strain or sprain of joints or ligaments of head

NA03.0	Dislocation of jaw
Displacement of the mandible, the largest and strongest bone of the face constituting the lower jaw. Dislocation of the temporomandibular joint is a painful condition that occurs when the mandibular condyle becomes fixed in the anterosuperior aspect of the articular eminence.
TMJ dislocation is due to either trauma or, more commonly, excessive opening of the mandible. Spasm of the masseter, temporalis, and internal pterygoid muscles results in trismus, preventing return of the condyle to the temporal fossa.

NF03.0	Chilblains
Chilblains are the result of cold-induced damage principally to the microvasculature of acral skin in susceptible individuals. They are commonest in the winter months in cold, damp climates. They present as itchy or painful red-purple macules, papules or plaques, most commonly affecting the fingers and toes, though other body extremities including the heels, nose and ears can be involved. Because of insulation from core body temperature, other areas, especially the lateral thighs, may be involved in areas where there is a thick layer of subcutaneous fat.

Affected extremities are initially cold, numb, swollen and pulseless; this is followed by a period of intense hyperaemia and pain which then gives way to increased sweating and cold sensitivity.
