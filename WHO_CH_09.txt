9A01.1	Abscess of eyelid

9A01.2	Hordeolum
An acute focal infection usually by Staphylococcus aureus involving the eyelash follicle and its associated meibomian and Zeis glands. If the principal focus of infection is the follicle, it presents with a painful boil which discharges pus at the eyelid margin (external hordeolum or stye). If the infection is centred on the meibomian gland (internal hordeolum) then suppuration onto the conjunctival surface occurs.

9A01.20	Hordeolum externum
An acute focal pyogenic infection of the eyelash follicle commonly known as a stye and caused predominantly by Staphylococcus aureus. It presents as an acute painful inflammatory eyelid swelling which subsequently discharges at the eyelid margin.

9A01.21	Hordeolum internum
A focal acute pyogenic infection, usually by Staphylococcus aureus, of a meibomian gland, the normal secretion from which into the eyelash follicle is blocked. It presents as an acute inflammatory swelling which may discharge onto the conjunctival surface of the eyelid, or rarely anteriorly through the eyelid skin. It may predispose to formation of a chalazion.
Exclusions:	Chalazion (9A02.0)

9A01.2Z	Hordeolum, unspecified

9A01.3	Infectious blepharitis
A condition of the eyelid, commonly caused by an infection with a bacterial source. This condition is characterised by pruritus, burning, scratchiness, excessive tearing, or crusty debris around the eyelashes. This condition may also present with lid erythema, collarettes, madarosis, trichiasis, or plugged meibomian glands. Transmission is by direct or indirect contact with an infected individual, endogenous spread, or through fomites.
Exclusions:	Blepharoconjunctivitis (9A60.4)

9A02.1	Posterior blepharitis
Posterior blepharitis is inflammation of the eyelids secondary to dysfunction of the meibomian glands. Like anterior blepharitis it is a bilateral chronic condition and manifested by a broad spectrum of symptoms involving the lids including inflammation and plugging of the meibomian orifices and production of abnormal secretion upon pressure over the glands. It may be associated with skin rosacea.

9A02.2	Ligneous conjunctivitis
Ligneous conjunctivitis (LC) is a rare form of chronic conjunctivitis characterised by the recurrent formation of pseudomembranous lesions most commonly on the palpebral surfaces. It is most frequently reported as a clinical manifestation of severe homozygous or compound-heterozygous hypoplasminogenaemia. Most cases involve infants and children.

9A02.4	Meibomian gland dysfunction
This refers to the dysfunction of a special kind of sebaceous gland at the rim of the eyelids inside the tarsal plate, responsible for the supply of meibum, an oily substance that prevents evaporation of the eye's tear film. Meibum prevents tear spillage onto the cheek, trapping tears between the oiled edge and the eyeball, and makes the closed lids airtight.

9A02.Y	Other specified inflammatory disorders of eyelid

  9A03  	Acquired malposition of eyelid

9A03.0	Blepharoptosis
Drooping of the upper lid due to deficient development or paralysis of the levator palpebrae muscle.

9A03.00	Marcus-Gunn syndrome
Marcus-Gunn syndrome is characterised by ptosis associated with maxillopalpebral synkinesis. The syndrome is generally unilateral and sporadic, but bilateral and autosomal dominant inherited cases have been reported.

9A03.01	Mechanical ptosis of eyelid

9A03.02	Myogenic ptosis of eyelid
This refers to a contraction initiated by the myocyte cell itself instead of an outside occurrence or stimulus such as nerve innervation, causing drooping or falling of the eyelid. The drooping may be worse after being awake longer, when the individual's muscles are tired.

9A03.03	Paralytic ptosis of eyelid

9A03.0Y	Other specified blepharoptosis

9A03.0Z	Blepharoptosis, unspecified

9A03.10	Cicatricial entropion of eyelid

9A03.11	Mechanical entropion of eyelid

9A03.12	Senile entropion of eyelid
This is a senile condition in which the eyelid (usually the lower lid) folds inward. It is very uncomfortable, as the eyelashes constantly rub against the cornea and irritate it. Entropion is usually caused by genetic factors and very rarely it may be congenital when an extra fold of skin grows with the lower eyelid (epiblepharon). Entropion can also create secondary pain of the eye (leading to self trauma, scarring of the eyelid, or nerve damage).

9A03.13	Spastic entropion of eyelid
This is a spastic condition in which the eyelid (usually the lower lid) folds inward. It is very uncomfortable, as the eyelashes constantly rub against the cornea and irritate it. Entropion is usually caused by genetic factors and very rarely it may be congenital when an extra fold of skin grows with the lower eyelid (epiblepharon). Entropion can also create secondary pain of the eye (leading to self trauma, scarring of the eyelid, or nerve damage).

9A03.1Y	Other specified entropion of eyelid

9A03.1Z	Entropion of eyelid, unspecified

9A03.24	Floppy eyelid syndrome
Acquired disorder of unknown origin, manifested by an easily everted floppy upper eyelid and papillary conjunctivitis of the upper palpebral conjunctiva. It is primarily associated with obese men and obstructive sleep apnoea. The tarsus of the upper eyelid becomes softer and looser probably due to mechanical forces and enzymatical changes. The upper eyelid everts during sleep, resulting in irritation, papillary conjunctivitis, and conjunctival keratinization. Effective treatment consists of preventing the upper eyelid from everting while the patient is sleeping.

9A04.0	Trichiasis without entropion
This refers to abnormally positioned eyelashes that grow back toward the eye, touching the cornea or conjunctiva. This can be caused by infection, inflammation, autoimmune conditions, congenital defects, eyelid agenesis and trauma such as burns or eyelid injury. This diagnosis is without a condition in which the eyelid (usually the lower lid) folds inward. It is very uncomfortable, as the eyelashes constantly rub against the cornea and irritate it.

9A04.1	Madarosis of eyelid or periocular area

Myokymia is used to describe an involuntary eyelid muscle contraction, typically involving the lower eyelid or less often the upper eyelid. It occurs in normal individuals and typically starts and disappears spontaneously. However, it can sometimes last up to three weeks. Since the condition typically resolves itself, medical professionals do not consider it to be serious or a cause for concern.

9A06.4	Xanthelasma of eyelid
Xanthelasmata are a form of plane xanthoma which manifest as sharply demarcated yellowish deposits of lipid within the skin of the eyelid. While they are neither harmful nor painful, these minor growths may be disfiguring and may be the presenting sign of hypercholesterolaemia. They are common in people of Asian origin and those from the Mediterranean region.

9A06.8	Blepharochalasis
This is a malposition of the eyelid caused either by involution or by inflammation of the eyelid. The inflammation is characterised by exacerbations and remissions of eyelid oedema, which results in a stretching and subsequent atrophy of the eyelid tissue resulting in redundant folds over the lid margins. It typically affects only the upper eyelids, and may be unilateral as well as bilateral.

Giant papillary conjunctivitis is a nonallergic hypersensitivity inflammation of the ocular surface, most frequently to contact lenses, ocular prostheses, postoperative sutures, and scleral buckles.

9A60.01	Acute atopic conjunctivitis
This is the allergic inflammation of the conjunctiva (mucous membrane that covers the posterior surface of the eyelids and the anterior pericorneal surface of the eyeball) of the immediate type, due to airborne allergens such as pollens, dusts, spores, and animal hair.

9A60.02	Allergic conjunctivitis
Allergic conjunctivitis is an IgE-mediated response due to the exposure of seasonal or perennial allergens in sensitized patients. The allergen-induced inflammatory response of the conjunctiva results in the release of histamine and other mediators. Symptoms consist of redness (mainly due to vasodilation of the peripheral small blood vessels), oedema (swelling) of the conjunctiva, itching, and increased lacrimation (production of tears).

9A60.5	Vernal keratoconjunctivitis
Vernal keratoconjunctivitis is a persistent and severe form of ocular allergy that affects children and young adults, usually in warm climates. Vernal keratoconjunctivitis typically appears in boys between the ages of 4–12 years. The typical symptoms are intense itching, tearing, and photophobia. Disease exacerbation can be triggered either by allergen re-exposure or by nonspecific stimuli such as sunlight, wind, and dust. The tarsal form is characterised by irregularly sized hypertrophic papillae, leading to a cobblestone appearance of the upper tarsal plate. The limbal form is characterised by transient, multiple limbal, or conjunctival gelatinous yellow-grey infiltrates superposed with white points or deposits, known as Horner–Trantas dots and papillae at the limbus.

  9A62  	Mucous membrane pemphigoid with ocular involvement
Mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) involving the conjunctivae is also known as ocular pemphigoid. This may be confined to the conjunctivae or may be associated with involvement of other sites as well. Its importance lies in its potential to cause loss of vision and it may thus warrant more aggressive therapy than would be considered for MMP of other sites.

This is the maximum stage of corneal oedema.
It is a pathological condition in which small vesicles, or bullae, are formed in the cornea due to endothelial dysfunction. In a healthy cornea, endothelial cells keeps the tissue from excess fluid absorption, pumping it back into the aqueous humour. When affected by some reason, such as Fuchs' dystrophy or a trauma during cataract removal, endothelial cells suffer mortality or damage. The corneal endothelial cells normally do not undergo mitotic cell division, and cell loss results in permanent loss of function.

9B71.3	Retinopathy of prematurity
Retinopathy of prematurity is a vasoproliferative disorder that affects extremely premature infants potentially leading to severe visual impairment or blindness. Exposure of newborn premature infants to hyperoxia down regulates retinal vascular endothelial growth factor, Blood vessels constrict and can become obliterated, resulting in delays of normal retinal vascular development. Low birth weight, young gestational age, and severity of illness (e.g. respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, sepsis) are associated factors. It primarily occurs in extremely low birth weight infants because of the cessation of normal retinal vascular maturation.

9B71.4	Paraneoplastic retinopathy
Paraneoplastic retinopathies results from a targeted attack on the retina due to a tumour immune response initiated by onco-neural antigens derived from systemic cancer. Patients usually present after cancer diagnosis with progressive visual dimming and photopsias but dysfunction of rods (impaired dark adaption and peripheral vision loss) and cones (decreased visual acuity, colour dysfunction, photosensitivity and glare) may also occur. Symptoms are often worse than clinical signs. Other causes of retinopathy should be excluded. Multiple anti-retinal autoantibodies (e.g. anti-recoverin antibodies) are described although their significance is uncertain. Two major subsets are recognised: cancer-associated-retinopathy (most commonly small-cell-lung-cancer) and melanoma-associated-retinopathy.

The symptoms are often worse than the clinical signs on fundoscopy. Multiple anti-retinal autoantibodies (e.g. anti-recoverin antibodies) are described although their significance is uncertain. Autoimmune retinopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion and other causes of retinopathy need to be ruled out, while the potential role of immunotherapy remains uncertain.

Disorders of refraction or accommodation (BlockL1‑9D0)
  9D00  	Disorders of refraction

9D00.0	Myopia
A refractive error in which rays of light entering the eye parallel to the optic axis are brought to a focus in front of the retina when ocular accommodation is relaxed. This usually results from the eyeball being too long from front to back, but can be caused by an overly curved cornea, a lens with increased optical power, or both. It is also called nearsightedness.
Exclusions:	degenerative myopia (9B76)

9D00.1	Hypermetropia
A refractive error in which rays of light entering the eye parallel to the optic axis are brought to a focus behind the retina, as a result of the eyeball being too short from front to back. It is also called farsightedness because the near point is more distant than it is in emmetropia with an equal amplitude of accommodation.

9D00.2	Astigmatism
Unequal curvature of the refractive surfaces of the eye. Thus a point source of light cannot be brought to a point focus on the retina but is spread over a more or less diffuse area. This results from the radius of curvature in one plane being longer or shorter than the radius at right angles to it.

9D00.3	Presbyopia
The normal decreasing elasticity of the crystalline lens that leads to loss of accommodation.

Polyopia (9D53)
  9D40  	Impairment of visual acuity
Visual acuity refers to the ability to recognize details at the point of fixation, which usually is the fovea. It is expressed as an angular measure, usually measured as distance and/or near acuity.

  9D41  	Impairment of visual field
Ranges of visual field impairment refer to the extent of peripheral vision outside fixation. The extent should be measured for each eye separately.

  9D42  	Patterns of visual field impairment
Patterns of visual field impairment are often indicative for certain disease conditions.

9D42.0	Visual field loss, pattern not specified

9D42.1	Normal Visual Field

9D42.2	Peripheral field deficit

9D42.20	Enlarged blind spot
Inclusions:	Scotoma of blind spot area

9D42.21	Arcuate scotoma
A Bjerrum or arcuate scotoma follows the pattern of the retinal nerve fibres. It is typical for glaucomatous defects and can also be caused by juxta-papillary lesions.

9D42.22	Nasal step
A nasal step is a discontinuity of the nasal field limit at the horizontal meridian. It is typical for glaucoma.

9D42.23	Ring scotoma
A ring scotoma is a scotoma that surrounds the central field. Initially, it may consist of several smaller scotomas that gradually coalesce.

9D42.24	Isolated peripheral scotoma
Isolated scotomas may be the result of scarring from infections or surgery.

9D42.2Y	Other specified peripheral field deficit

9D42.3	Hemianopic or quadrantic loss
Defects that cover a hemi-field or a quadrant in one eye may be the result of optic nerve involvement.

9D42.4	Central scotoma
A central scotoma is a defect that covers the fovea. It therefore causes visual acuity loss and may necessitate eccentric fixation.

9D42.5	Para-central scotoma
A para-central scotoma is a scotoma adjacent to the fovea. Both may minimally affect letter chart acuity, but may interfere significantly with reading and other activities.

9D42.6	Homonymous hemianopia or quadrant anopia
Homonymous, binocular field defects present the same or similar patterns in both eyes. They are caused by lesions of the retro-chiasmal pathways.

  9D43  	Impairment of contrast vision
Contrast sensitivity refers to the ability to distinguish small differences in brightness between adjacent surfaces.
Peak Contrast sensitivity refers to the smallest differences that are discernible for large stimuli.
For smaller objects, such as those involved in many Activities of Daily Living, contrast sensitivity interacts with visual acuity and visual field. Better contrast makes smaller details visible. The visual field is larger for stronger stimuli.

  9D44  	Impairment of colour vision
Colour vision refers to the ability to distinguish colour differences. True colour “blindness” is extremely rare. Most colour vision deficiencies are minor, and congenital, with X-linked recessive inheritance (more prevalent among men). Some drugs and optic neuritis may also cause colour vision deficiencies.

Vision impairment (BlockL1‑9D9)
A vision impairment results when an eye condition affects the visual system and one or more of its vision functions. Typically, population-based surveys measure visual impairment using exclusively visual acuity, with severity categorized as mild, moderate or severe distance vision impairment or blindness, and near vision impairment. However, in the clinical setting, other visual functions are also often assessed, such as a person’s field of vision, contrast sensitivity and colour vision.
  9D90  	Vision impairment including blindness
The table below gives a classification of severity of vision impairment recommended by the Resolution of the International Council of Ophthalmology (2002) and the Recommendations of the WHO Consultation on “Development of Standards for Characterization of Vision Loss and Visual Functioning" (September 2003)
For characterizing binocular vision impairment, vision acuity should be measured with both eyes open with presenting correction if any. For characterizing monocular visual impairment, visual acuity should be measured monocularly with presenting correction if any.
If the extent of the visual field is taken into account, patients with a visual field of the better eye no greater than 10° in radius around central fixation should be placed under ‘inocular’. For monocular blindness, this degree of field loss would apply to the affected eye.
